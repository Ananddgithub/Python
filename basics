1. Basics
		print("Hello Anand")
	
2. Variables  : 
	FYI :
 case sensitive, letters (a-z), underscore, numbers (0-9), cannot add int with string, no space in bw twenty_one
	values can be string or numbers, string should be with double quotes
		
	sample code
	
		x = "twenty_one "
		y = "days"
		z = x+y
		print("two thousand and " + z)
		
	output: two thousand and twenty_one days
		
3. Syntax

		if 10 > 8:
			print ("10 is greater than 8")    # spacing here is important
		else :
			print ("10 is lesser than 8")
	
	output: 10 is greater than 8
	
4. Function

		def sum(a,b):						# spacing here is important	
			print(a-b)
		c = sum(36,23)
	

        output: 13
	
5. CommandLine
		
		open cmd prompt, navigate to the location where python file is and run "python <filename>"
		
6. Comments
		
		select the line and press ctrl+/ to comment

7. Numbers
	
		anand_age = 30						#int
		anand_height = 5.9					#float
		anand_door_no = 45j					# j -> complex, other alphabets are not allowed as values

		print (type(anand_age))				#type -> will tell the type of number in the value	
		print (type(anand_age))
		print (type(anand_door_no))	

	Output:
	<class 'int'>
	<class 'int'>
	<class 'complex'>

8. Casting

	
		anand_age = int(30.7)
		anand_height = float(6)
		anand_weight = int(96)
		anand_previous_height = str(5.9) 

		print (anand_age)
		print (anand_height)
		print (anand_weight)
		print (anand_previous_height)
	
	Output:
	
	30
	6.0
	96
	5.9 									#"5.9 here is a string"
	
9. Strings

	full_name = "Anand_Devanathan"
												Output
	print (len(full_name))					16
	print (full_name[0:5])					Anand				#index starts from 0 and uses square brackets
	print (full_name[6:16])					Devanathan
	print (full_name.lower())				anand_devanathan
	print (full_name.upper())				ANAND_DEVANATHAN
	print (full_name.strip())									#will trim the empty spaces before and after the declared value
	print (full_name.replace("_", "."))	    Anand.Devanathan
	print (full_name.split("_"))			['Anand', 'Devanathan']  		#will split your variable into individual variable
	
10. Input
	
	print ("Enter your first name : ")
	print ("Enter your last name : ")

	first_name = input()
	last_name  = input()

	print ("My full name is " + first_name + last_name)	
	
	Output: 
	Enter your first name : 
	Enter your last name : 
	Anand
	 Devanathan
	
	Final Output: 
	
	My full name is Anand Devanathan
